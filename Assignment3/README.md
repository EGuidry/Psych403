## Variable Operations Exercises
1)  Which form of subnr (int or str) can be added to sub_code to create the output "sub2"? Why don't both work?
    - subnr_str
    - Both won't work because you can't add a string (a word) and a interger (a number) together, but you can add str + str, and int + int.

## List Operations Exercises
1) See [Assignment3.py](https://github.com/EGuidry/Psych403/blob/main/Assignment3/Assignment3.py). 
2) What is the difference between multiplying lists and multiplying arrays?  
   - Multiplying lists duplicates the whole list. (Ex: [1, 2, 3,]*2 = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3,]) 
   - Multiplying arrays, multiplies each item in the array. (Ex: [1, 2, 3,]*2 = [2, 4, 6])
