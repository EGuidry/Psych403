## Clock Exercises
Question 1: See [ClockExercisesQ1](https://github.com/EGuidry/Psych403/blob/main/Assignment7/ClockExercisesQ1.py)
- The core is percise enough that the only change is after a 1000th of a second.
  - Image Duration was 2.000733399996534 seconds
  - Image Duration was 2.000278800027445 seconds
  - Image Duration was 2.0002308000111952 seconds
  - Image Duration was 2.0006673999596387 seconds
  
Question 2: See [ClockExercisesQ2](https://github.com/EGuidry/Psych403/blob/main/Assignment7/ClockExercisesQ2.py)
- "wait_timer" is more efficent than "clock_wait_timer" - clock_wait changes after a 10th of a second.
  - Image Duration was 1.0103130000061356 seconds
  - Image Duration was 1.0004403000348248 seconds
  - Image Duration was 1.015927999978885 seconds
  - Image Duration was 1.0021043000160716 seconds
 
Question 3: See [ClockExercisesQ3](https://github.com/EGuidry/Psych403/blob/main/Assignment7/ClockExercisesQ3.py)
- While some change happens after a 10th of a second, the average shows that "countdown_timer" is more precise than "clock_wait_timer" but less percise than "wait_timer"
